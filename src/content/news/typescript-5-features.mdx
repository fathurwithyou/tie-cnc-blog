# TypeScript 5.0 Features Deep Dive

TypeScript 5.0 brings significant improvements and new features that enhance developer experience and code reliability. Let's explore the key additions that make this release noteworthy.

## Decorators Support

One of the most anticipated features in TypeScript 5.0 is the official support for decorators. This feature allows developers to add metadata and modify classes, methods, and properties declaratively.

```typescript
function logged(target: any, propertyName: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  const method = descriptor.value;
  descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
    console.log(`Calling ${propertyName} with arguments:`, args);
    return method.apply(this, args);
  };
}

class Calculator {
  @logged
  add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  }
}
```

## Performance Enhancements

TypeScript 5.0 introduces significant performance improvements:

- **Faster type checking** - Up to 20% improvement in large codebases
- **Reduced memory usage** - More efficient internal data structures
- **Improved incremental compilation** - Better caching strategies

## New Utility Types

Several new utility types have been added to make common type transformations easier:

```typescript
// Const assertion improvements
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'] as const;
type Fruit = typeof fruits[number]; // 'apple' | 'banana' | 'orange'

// Template literal pattern improvements
type EventName<T extends string> = `on${Capitalize<T>}`;
type ClickEvent = EventName<'click'>; // 'onClick'
```

## Enhanced Error Messages

TypeScript 5.0 provides more helpful error messages with better context and suggestions for common mistakes.

## Migration Guide

Upgrading to TypeScript 5.0 is straightforward for most projects:

1. Update your TypeScript version: `npm install -D typescript@5.0`
2. Update your tsconfig.json if needed
3. Run type checking to identify any breaking changes
4. Consider enabling new features like decorators

## Conclusion

TypeScript 5.0 represents a significant step forward in the language's evolution, offering better performance, enhanced features, and improved developer experience. The addition of decorators and performance improvements make it a compelling upgrade for any TypeScript project.
