# **Intro**

Ever wanted to try and compete on Competitive Programming (CP)? Is it hard to find a way to start? Don't worry! We'll guide on how to start CP, starting from the basics, so let's get started!

## What is Competitive Programming?

Competitive Programming is a mind sport where participants are given a problem and have to solve it by making an efficient program under given constraints. Usually, the program is written in languages such as C++, Java, or Python, but it depends on the contest and the platform used.

## Problem Example

Almost all competitive programming problems have the same format: a problem name, description, constraints, input/output format, sample I/O with/without explanation, and time/memory limits. Here is a problem example:


**Output**  
Print a single line containing the number of pairs in the list which add up to \(10\).

**Examples**

Input:
```
5
3 7 2 8 8
```

Output:
```
3
```
